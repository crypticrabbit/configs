Configuration Files

##Synopsis
This purpose of this project is to provide a consistent set of configuration
files for terminal applications, such as vim and R, that I can access from
multiple computers.

##Installation
Clone the repository into your local home directory, and create symlinks in your home
directory to each of the dot files in the ~/configs/ directory. At some point, I
hope to provide a script that will automatically generate symlinks to each of
the configuration files.

##Motivation
Creating a consistent environment I can use for web design and data analysis.

##License
Anyone is free to use, modify, and distribute any of these files.
